WARN: postinst
Some software with pre-loaded PAM libraries might experience
warnings or failures related to missing symbols and/or versions
after any update. While unfortunate this is a limit of the
implementation of PAM and the software, and it requires you to
restart the software manually after the update.

You can get a list of such software running a command like
  lsof / | grep -E -i 'del.*libpam\.so'

Alternatively, simply reboot your system.

Some web pages may require additional fonts to display properly.
Try installing some of the following packages if some characters

- media-fonts/noto
- media-fonts/ja-ipafonts
- media-fonts/takao-fonts

To fix broken icons on the Downloads page, you should install an icon
theme that covers the appropriate MIME types, and configure this as your
GTK+ icon theme.

For native file dialogs in KDE, install kde-apps/kdialog.

To make password storage work with your desktop environment you may
have install one of the supported credentials management applications:
- app-crypt/libsecret (GNOME)
- kde-frameworks/kwallet (KDE)
If you have one of above packages installed, but don't want to use
them in Chromium, then add --password-store=basic to CHROMIUM_FLAGS
in /etc/chromium/default.

installed. Please look at /usr/share/doc/ungoogled-chromium-138.0.7204.168_p1/README.gentoo*
for future reference)
Hardware-accelerated video decoding configuration:

Chromium supports multiple backends for hardware acceleration. To enable one,
   Add to CHROMIUM_FLAGS in /etc/chromium/default:

1. VA-API with OpenGL (recommended for most users):
   --enable-features=AcceleratedVideoDecodeLinuxGL
   VaapiVideoDecoder may need to be added as well, but try without first.

2. Enhanced Wayland/EGL performance:
   --enable-features=AcceleratedVideoDecodeLinuxGL,AcceleratedVideoDecodeLinuxZeroCopyGL

3. VA-API with Vulkan:
   --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecoder,VaapiIgnoreDriverChecks,Vulkan,DefaultANGLEVulkan,VulkanFromANGLE

   NOTE: Vulkan acceleration requires X11 and will not work under Wayland sessions.
   Use OpenGL-based acceleration instead when running under Wayland.

Additional options:
  To enable hardware-accelerated encoding (if supported)
  add 'AcceleratedVideoEncoder' to your feature list
  VaapiIgnoreDriverChecks bypasses driver compatibility checks
  (may be needed for newer/unsupported hardware)

widevine requires binary plugins, which are distributed separately

To take advantage of the init script, and automate the process of

add alsasound to the boot runlevel. You can do this as

# rc-update add alsasound boot
